# No negative lookahead available here, which makes things difficult.

# We want checks to run on JUCE files included from the JUCE modules. We can
# restrict these to files named `juce_.*`.
#
# We also want checks to run on any files inlcuded from the examples or extras
# directories. However, some include paths generated by the Android Studio build
# system look like:
#
#   ~/JUCE/examples/DemoRunner/Builds/Android/app/../../../../../modules/juce_box2d/box2d/Collision/b2CollideEdge.cpp
#
# Since we can only opt-in to paths, we restrict the maximum depth of the path
# past examples/extras.
