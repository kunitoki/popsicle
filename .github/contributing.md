## Contributing

#### Feature Requests

Any feature requests should be posted to the [Feature
Requests](https://forum.juce.com/c/feature-requests/) section of the JUCE
forum.

#### Bug Reports

The [JUCE forum](https://forum.juce.com/) is also the best place to file bug
reports. The JUCE developers are very active there and will read every post and
respond accordingly.

#### Pull Requests

You must sign the [JUCE Contribution Licence Agreement](https://cla.juce.com/)
before your code can be considered for inclusion into JUCE. The automated build
of your Pull Request (PR) will fail if either the author or committer of any
commits in your PR has not signed the Contribution Licence Agreement.

This repository contains just the public branches of the main JUCE development
repository. Any work in your PR will not be merged into any other branch in
this repository, but will instead be reproduced in our private repository. We
may refactor and rewite any code submitted to us in PRs.

All work should be based on our `develop` branch.

#### Code Of Conduct

All interactions of any kind with the code in this repository or the
surrounding commentary in Issues or Pull Requests must abide by our [Code of
Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).
